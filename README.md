# Personal Knowledge Base

This is an experiment in note taking with the Zettelkasten method. Notes are markdown files rendered with [Neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/) which generates backlinks and an index, and provides other convenience features.

See the [published version](https://neurrone.github.io/personal-knowledge-base) here.

## Running locally

With Docker installed, `docker-compose up` to spin up a development server. Then go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see the locally running copy of the site.

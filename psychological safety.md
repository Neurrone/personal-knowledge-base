# Psychological Safety

This is the shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking.

Psychological Safety is a means to an end - the system is more agile or the team performs better.

*Psychological Safety must be matched with skill*. Once something is in the system that the system does not know how to handle, that causes safety to plummet.

When doing systems intervention, remember to also diagnose how much competence there is in the system.

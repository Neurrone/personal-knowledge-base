# Organism and Environment

Mammals are always aware of the environment due to a survival instinct. If they are aware of danger, they retreat to safety. They enter the environment (go outside of safety) to survive (hunt for food, water).

Examples:

* I'm the organism in the FPC 2 cohort. Everyone else is the environment
* I'm the organism, my team or another department is the environment

Environments shift constantly, creating threat.

When there's a watering hole, mammals go there for survival. But predators go there too. When the zebra and lion are drinking water, the zebra feels threatened by the lion. The zebra has no choice but to be there.

But if the zebra knew the lion has just recently eaten, there is some safety.

If there's a choice, the zebra will never stand next to the lion. But it does so because there's no choice, its needed for survival.

The zebra cannot change into a lion to survive.

But *humans can change and become different people*, depending on what container they're in.

In this analogy, Humans want to be the lion to avoid being eaten but they are unhappy. This is also related to the [[paradoxical-theory-of-change]].

People feel safer when there is more information in the environment (related to vulnerability). When someone is angry but it is left unsaid, threat goes up.

Before going into higher order work (emotions and relationships need to be taken care of first before learning), your primitive / reptilian brain need to be taken care of first.

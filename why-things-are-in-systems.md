3. [[organism-and-environment]]: the system can adapt better when it sees the environment
4. [[paradoxical-theory-of-change]]
5. In order to fully integrate, we need to first fully differentiate.
    * I've only understood this experientially, am currently have trouble writing this down, hence why this is not its own page.

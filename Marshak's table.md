# Under, On And Above The Table

This is from Marshak's work on covert processes.

* *Overt*: this is what goes on the table for discussion because people in the organization assess it to be legitimate or acceptable. This depends on the individuals and the organization.
* *Covert*: topics that can't be discussed openly are knocked off the table but do not go away. They continue to exist. The 5 places where covert processes manifest are:
    1. Things outside awareness in prisms (lenses that you view the world) e.g mindsets
    2. Negative things: e.g politics and negative emotions
    3. Things that are unexpressed and above the clouds: inspirations, "this is too good to ever happen", tacit beliefs that it is inappropriate to express optimism. Unexpressed due to a fear of ridicule.
    4. Things that are repressed and buried in the subconscious: deep fears and anxieties
    5. Untapped potential: things in the superconscious (positive aspects of the what people are unconscious of).

Organizations will survive if most stuff is under the table. To thrive, this stuff needs to come onto the table, which will only happen when there is [[psychological safety]]

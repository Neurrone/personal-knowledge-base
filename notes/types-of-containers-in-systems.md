# Types of Containers In Human Systems

Containers are set up by:

1. *Infrastructure*: how groups are formed (linguistically), where groups meet, seating, etc
2. *Knowledge*: what knowledge does the group have? Does everyone in the group have the same knowledge?
3. *Identity and boundaries*: how you present yourself also forms a boundary.
4. *Relationships*: what are the existing relationships in the system?
5. *Language and Emergent Language*: linguistic clarity / construction, emergent language (my cohort adopted the term "pop corn" participation)

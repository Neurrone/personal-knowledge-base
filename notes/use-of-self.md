    Interventions should restore abundance to the system. This requires that the intervener is also in a state of abundance to be able to give, only possible by managing the following types of debt:
    
    * *Somatic debt*: sleep, exercise, diet
    * *Emotional debt*: anger -> forgiveness, fear -> trust, sadness -> acceptance
    * Language: use requests, offers, promises and declarations more intentionally
3. Build [[trust]]
4. Presence (attention) = power with trust + intention. Presence is increased with self-work[^1].
5. [[be-do-have]]
6. [[power]]

[^1]: one way of getting attention before trust is built with the system is to use the [Perceived Weirdness Index](http://www.ideasunlimited.com/blog-leadership-development/perceived-weirdness-index/). Doing something "weird" enough to draw attention, not too much though which provokes rejection. E.g, standing in front barefooted.

# Use Of Self

> A single person can change the system only if they are aware of what they're doing with themselves.

> Demanding provision from a system that is itself made up of depleted individuals is likely a futile and hope-depleting endeavour. Wisdom would have it that we respond with not more demands, but more self-care; to replenish our own personal systems such that we do not incur more debt on behalf of the system. And this I must say is surely an act of love; for after over 20 years of meeting the needs of people in all levels of systems, I can tell you that this is a courageous and selfless act that is rare, and made even more difficult when our systems do not reciprocate.

1. Managing debt:
    > When the intervener is in survival, the intervener cannot see
    
    Interventions should restore abundance to the system. This requires that the intervener is also in a state of abundance to be able to give, only possible by managing the following types of debt:
    
    * *Somatic debt*: sleep, exercise, diet, ritual
    * *Emotional debt*: emotional moods affect our adaptability when we know longer experience a wide range of emotions, but a predictable response to similar situations.
        * Attend to past trauma that affects how you see.
        * Make it a habitual choice to forgive, trust and accept which reduces strong moods of anger, fear and sadness respectively.
    * *Language*: pay attention to your your linguistic experience and how you describe and assess the world. How you describe work, relationships or anything else shapes the experience and how how much perceived debt you're in.
        
        > Optimism or a belief in pronoia, are powerful linguistic interventions into our own psyche and sense of provision. Actively offering, requesting and declaring also can dramatically change our experience of abundance in the world.

3. Presence (attention) = power with trust + intention. Presence is increased with self-work[^1].

[^1]: one way of getting attention before trust is built with the system is to use the [Perceived Weirdness Index](http://www.ideasunlimited.com/blog-leadership-development/perceived-weirdness-index/). Doing something "weird" enough to draw attention, not too much though which provokes rejection. E.g, standing in front barefooted.

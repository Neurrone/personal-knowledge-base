# 5 Conversations For Human Work

1. *Aspirational*: what is our mission? Objective for the next 5 years?
2. *Work*
3. *Safety*: this impacts healing
4. *Healing*
5. *Power and Politics*: this sucks, want to challenge it. E.g racial politics. Leads to a desire to change aspirations. What happens when you feel you don't belong. Who gets to decide because this system is not serving me.

    This is not necessarily bad, e.g water cooler conversations.

The first 2 are on the table, while the rest are typically [under the table](marshaks-table.md).

There're 2 ways that conversations could go:

1. Aspiration -> work -> safety -> healing
2. Aspiration -> work -> safety -> power and politics -> back to aspiration
    * When there is safety, there is a tendency to not want to proceed with healing, which always has pain. Also requires skill in the system.

Examples:

* A child is not doing homework because the conversation to set up an aspiration that the child then owns is missing. Often, parents proceed to talk about work, skipping the aspiration conversation entirely.
    
    This is equally applicable in the work setting.
* Racial politics and Trump's election campaign are examples of what happens when after safety, healing is not done and there's a desire to redefine aspirations.

Intervening in these factors is done through the appropriate container.

Marking this a stub because I haven't been able to find any references about this in the literature to do further research.

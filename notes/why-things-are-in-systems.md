# Why Things Are In Human Systems

These concepts explain why things happen in systems.

1. [[abundance-and-scarcity]]
2. Organizations are linguistic.
    * People join organizations but work streams put people in departments. Just being in separate departments (a linguistic construct) creates so many problems.
3. [[organism-and-environment]]: the system can adapt better when it sees the environment
4. [[paradoxical-theory-of-change]]
5. [[differentiation-and-integration-in-systems]]

# Trust

The 4 pillars of trust are:

1. *Sincerity*: the other person's internal and external conversations are not contradictory, the other person acts in according to what they say they believe and care about.
2. *Competence*: the other person is able to do what they propose by having the knowledge, skill and resources needed to accomplish the task.
3. *Reliability*: the other person has kept their promises in the past, and will continue to do so in the future.
4. *Care*: the other person has our best interests in mind and will act in ways that reflect concern for our well-being and what we consider important.

Each of these aspects of trust is an assessment we make of the other person. If we don't trust someone, it is usually because one of these is missing.

"I trust you" is a declaration.

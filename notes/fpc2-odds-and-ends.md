# FPC2 Odds And Ends

Personal reflections and other misc odds and ends that don't fit anywhere else

## Impactful Pieces

This is stuff I understand from seeing first-hand or takeaways from my own experiences. I can't put this into words, for now.

* Systems can be really powerful for healing.
* Systems can also be incredibly violent as well. It takes very little for things to explode.
* Self awareness is critical for separating out purely intrapersonal work from work that should be brought up to the system level.
* The system can be smart enough to have answers that you don't. Whether the system is agile and adaptive depends on whether the system knows.
* Learning to tap into intuition.
* I noticed an unspoken cultural norm that you must always have an answer. A valid response (assuming the prerequisite safety is present) is also "I don't know, but I'm willing to learn how".

## What Next After FPC 2?

I started to be preoccupied with the question about what next on the second last day.

* If you're the only individual in a system you care about with this knowledge, how can this scale to be more sustainable?
* How can this be taught to others? A lot of what I learnt in FPC 2 was highly experiential. Should this experience be replicated or is there another way to teach this stuff?
* For self-development, consider taking part 1 of the Newfield certification

# The 4 Somatic Archetypes

Each person has a preferred archetype, but it is possible to express the other 3 with practice to build range. There are situations where each disposition would be useful.

1. *Warrior*: task-oriented, aggressive
2. *Lover*: openness. opposite of the warrior
3. *King / Queen*: stability, tradition, sandbox
4. *Jester*:lightness, does not see boundaries. the opposite of the kingly / queenly archetype.

Better understood with a demonstration of how each looks like. But marking as a stub anyways, to be expanded on later.

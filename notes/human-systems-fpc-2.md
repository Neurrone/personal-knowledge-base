# Human Systems (FPC 2)

> The natural state of systems is decay.

These notes are from the course [Facilitating Powerful Conversations (FPC) Level 2 by The Thought Collective](https://thethoughtcollective.com.sg/class_details/FACILITATING_POWERFUL_CONVERSATIONS_LEVEL_2) taken on 5 - 9 Oct 2020. I prefer using the title Human Systems for this.

FPC 2 is a highly experiential course which distills the learning from the [iGOLD program](https://www.gestaltod.org/programs/igold-program/about-the-igold-program/). It builds up from FPC level 1 which focuses on self awareness and discovery. A system is a group of individuals that come together for a common purpose. The main focus in FPC 2 is how to intervene at the system level, which requires understanding the unit of a system: the individual.

While the literature on intrapersonal models are in agreement, Systems work is still an active area of research, so this might change.

1. [Why things are](why-things-are-in-systems.md): why are things the way they are, and what causes scarcity?
2. [What to intervene on](patterns-in-systems.md): patterns useful for diagnosis
3. [Where to intervene: containers](containers-in-systems.md)
4. [How to intervene](intervening-in-systems.md)
5. Who intervenes: [[use-of-self]] / self-work. The use of self is the foundation on which everything else above stands.

Misc notes that don't fit in anywhere else:

* Shadow systems are non-legitimate systems set up to gain power. E.g The Gatekeepers, the Pyramid Club. Whether they are good or bad is down to intention
* [[fpc2-reflections]]

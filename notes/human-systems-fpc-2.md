# Human Systems (FPC 2)

These notes are for the course [Facilitating Powerful Conversations (FPC) Level 2](https://thethoughtcollective.com.sg/class_details/FACILITATING_POWERFUL_CONVERSATIONS_LEVEL_2) by The Thought Collective taken on 5 - 9 Oct 2020.

I prefer to call it Human Systems, hence the title of this note.

1. [Why things are](why-things-are-in-systems.md): why are things the way they are, and what causes scarcity?
2. [What to intervene on](patterns-in-systems.md): patterns useful for diagnosis
3. [Where to intervene: containers](containers-in-systems.md)
4. [How to intervene](intervening-in-systems.md)
5. Who intervenes: use of self / self-work

# Assertions

An assertion is a speech act where the speaker establishes the facts of life - what is true or false for the speaker and listener. For example, I am 6 feet tall, it is 32 degrees outside.

* Assertions are where language is the most descriptive and least generative.
* Assertions are either true or false and can be verified by an objective third party with the requisite distinctions. E.g, the distinction of feet to verify if a room is 60 by 30.
* Assertions belong to the thing being observed. The room is 30 by 20 is a property that belongs to the room.
* Assertions are descriptive and factual, and are about the past or present.
* Assertions are not influenced by mood or emotions.
* Socially, we are expected to only make true assertions and provide supporting evidence if asked.
    
    Language generates and creates, not just describes. Make a bunch of true assertions over time, and you will generate an identity for yourself of “trustworthy” or “reliable.” Make a bunch of false assertions and over time, you will just as surely generate a public identity for yourself of “liar.” And if you consistently fail to provide evidence to back up the assertions you make, same thing.

Contrast this with [[assessments]].

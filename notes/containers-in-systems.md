# Containers In Systems

Humans are unique in our ability to change who we are depending on which container we're in. We're not the same person at home vs in the workplace, the friends we're in or the country we're in.

A container is a context for a conversation to take place. Setting up containers more intentionally helps to change the system. This is where intervention happens.

* We hold back on parts of ourselves we would like the system to know, depending on the container we're in.
* Besides the observer, what is figural also depends on container.
* Being consciously aware of the current container is important.

Containers do not exist unless spoken into being through a declaration or a promise.

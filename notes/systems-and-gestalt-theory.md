# Systems And Gestalt Theory

## Systems Theory

* This is a very analytical approach
* Focuses on patterns, cause/effect, finding out *what is missing*
* Historical analysis
* Looks at what is scarce
* This is diagnostic work

## Gestalt Theory

Takes an opposite approach to system theory in many ways.

* Focuses on completion, wholism, positives
* Focuses on the hear and now (the past will take care of itself when you're healthy)
* Abundance-based approach

> We are not agents of change: we are agents of awareness

Gestalt therapists believe that change should come from the individual, and that their role is to provide awareness.
